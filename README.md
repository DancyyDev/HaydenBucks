Love coffee? This is an app where a chashier adds the coffee order and sends it to the barista's side of the app and their, they make the coffee, complete it, and delet it when the customer recieves the order.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Node.js

A group project on creating a replica of an ordering system, where the cashier inputs orders and the orders appear on the barista side. THere, the barista can see what the customer ordered, mark it complete and delete it.

## Optimizations

A great start to a real life application. I can improve on how the data is rendered on the screen. Such as when the oder comes to the barista, can they edit the order? When it completes can it announce when the order is finished? Small things that can make the program eaier to work and help the client better.

## Lessons Learned:

Learned more about create a fullstack app than I did before. Understood how to use the EJS syntax better to render more data from the database.
